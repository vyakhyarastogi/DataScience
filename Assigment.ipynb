    "\n",
    "Properties of Measurement Scales:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Nominal Scale – Nominal variables can be placed into categories. These don’t have a numeric value and so cannot be added, subtracted, divided or multiplied. \n",
    "For example, gender is an example of a variable that is measured on a nominal scale. Individuals may be classified as “male” or “female”, but neither value represents more or less “gender” than the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)The ordinal scale contains things that you can place in order. It measures a variable in terms of magnitude, or rank. Ordinal scales tell us relative order, but give us no information regarding differences between the categories.\n",
    "For example, in a race If Ram takes first and Vidur takes second place, we do not know competition was close by how many seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Interval Scale –\n",
    "An interval scale has ordered numbers with meaningful divisions, the magnitude between the consecutive intervals are equal.\n",
    "For example, temperature on Fahrenheit/Celsius thermometer i.e. 90° are hotter than 45° and the difference between 10° and 30° are the same as the difference between 60° degrees and 80°.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)The ratio scale: of measurement is similar to the interval scale in that it also represents quantity and has equality of units with one major difference: zero is meaningful (no numbers exist below the zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in distance 10 miles is twice as long as 5 mile."
